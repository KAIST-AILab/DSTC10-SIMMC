System : Sorry, which table do you like? <EOS>
System : People seem to be thrilled with it! This table has an average customer rating of 4.3. <EOS>
System : Like I said, the table you prefer is rated at 4.3, which is superior to the other table's rating of 3.2. Both tables are made of wood and have a nice earthy brown color. River Chateau makes the table on the blue rug, whereas the brand of the table on the other side of that wall is StyleNow Feed. <EOS>
System : Why not one of the wooden tables in the back by the shelves or the green chair? <EOS>
System : I'll add both of these wooden tables to your cart. <EOS>
System : They are both made by StyleNow Feed. <EOS>
System : Of course, I'll add it. <EOS>
System : I found a brown one behind the lamp in the middle and a brown one next to the red sofa. <EOS>

System : No problem. The one to the left is from River Chateau and the one to the right is from StyleNow Feed. <EOS>
System : Wonderful! I'll add those to your cart. <EOS>

System : Was that for the grey rug? <EOS>
System : It comes from North Lodge and is made of wool. <EOS>
System : I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. <EOS>
System : Which wooden tables? <EOS>
System : Sure, they both cost $399, but the one on the right has a 3.2 rating, while the one on the left has a 4.3. <EOS>
System : The wooden table in the back left is from River Chateau. <EOS>
System : That first brown chair by the red sofa could be the chair of your dreams! <EOS>
System : That brown chair still fits the bill, but you might also consider the other brown one further back by the green sofa. Does that one resonate with you more? <EOS>
System : Do you mind specifying which product you're inquiring about? <EOS>
System : Thank you for resolving the confusion. Both of those are made with leather, as per your preferences. <EOS>
System : I think the grey rug in the center of this room may be what you are looking for. <EOS>
System : The wooden table in this room is from River Chateau, and the wooden table in the other room is from StyleNow Feed. <EOS>
System : What tables do you mean? <EOS>

System : What do you think about the wooden table behind the brown chair? <EOS>
System : Which brown chair? <EOS>
System : That chair is priced at $349 and made of leather. <EOS>
System : The gray striped rug that has the green couch on it has a good rating.  How about it? <EOS>
System : No, I don't happen to carry any leather area rugs, unfortunately. <EOS>
System : Nice choice.  I'll add it to your cart. <EOS>
System : That brown chair is the only item we have like it. <EOS>
System : Take a lok at the table in the back center and the wooden table to the back left. <EOS>
System : These tables are both made of wood. <EOS>
System : Okay, that's noted. I've put one table and one chair into your cart. <EOS>
System : Of course. Adding a second wooden table to your cart. <EOS>
System : You might enjoy the brown chair just beyond the white rug or the brown chair close to the red sofa. <EOS>

System : Have a look at the brown chair just to the right of the brown table. <EOS>
System : Sure, I will add that to your cart. <EOS>
System : One you might like is the gray striped rug which the green sofa is sitting on. <EOS>

System : Which chair do you want to know about? <EOS>
System : That chair is priced at $299 and is made of leather. <EOS>
System : You may consider the brown chair next to the red couch or the one back behind the teal couch. <EOS>
System : You could consider the rug under the teal couch. <EOS>
System : Those two are the only ones of that type available. <EOS>
System : Great! I'll add them to your cart. <EOS>
System : Look at that brown couch up in the front by the red sofa, and also the brown one towards the back on the white rug. <EOS>
System : No, there's nothing more affordable. <EOS>
System : Alright, doing so now. <EOS>
System : Okay, I'll add that too. <EOS>
System : The chair in the back on the blue rug could work. <EOS>
System : Sorry, none of our available chairs are from River Chateau. <EOS>
System : There is no difference; both are made of wood. <EOS>
System : Just those two. <EOS>
System : What do you think about the wooden table and the other wooden table on the other side of the divide? <EOS>
System : Sorry, I can't find anything that matches your criteria. How else can I help you? <EOS>

System : I cannot locate any shirt with these characteristics. I am sorry for that. <EOS>
System : Sure! I have just added them. <EOS>
System : They have the same pattern, vertical stripes, but the shirt on our right is more expensive, at 79.99. The other blue and white shirt costs 54.99. <EOS>

System : The one-legged tables in the back both fit the bill! <EOS>
System : Allow me to propose the chair to the left on the white rug. <EOS>
System : Unfortunately, my search did not turn up any results. How else can I help you? <EOS>
System : The white table deals a softer blow, with a price tag of $399. The black one retails for $549. Both tables are constructed with wood. <EOS>

System : The back one is $399  and the front one is $549. <EOS>

System : Which coffee table? <EOS>
System : That's rated at a 3.5. <EOS>

System : Take a look at that brown one on the white lined rug. Does that cater to your style? <EOS>
System : So glad I could help! I'll put those items in your cart right away. <EOS>
System : What do you think of the two coffee tables on the rug in front of the green and black sofas?  They are both from the more expensive side of our inventory. <EOS>
System : Sorry, I don't have anything matching those criteria. <EOS>
System : Sorry, those two are the only coffee tables in the expensive price range I can offer. <EOS>
System : Certainly, I've added the blue rug to your cart. <EOS>

System : I wish I could, but there are no related designs for you to view at this time. <EOS>
System : That long grey one in the back and the cute little brown sofa nub have been flying! <EOS>
System : Sorry, I can't find anything that matches your criteria. <EOS>
System : Sorry, we don't have anything like that. Do you want to see anything else? <EOS>
System : Sure, I'll add them to your cart. <EOS>
System : Will do. <EOS>

System : Unfortunately, I don't have any similar items in gray wool.. <EOS>

System : I couldn't find any coffee tables with good ratings. <EOS>
System : The brown chair to the right, behind the shelves, could work. What do you think? <EOS>
System : Sorry, that's all I could find. <EOS>
System : For sofas, I would recommend the grey one in the very back, a little to the left, or the small brown one at the front of the blue rug. <EOS>

System : That brown one you already saw is expensive. <EOS>
System : I don't happen to have any affordable sofas right now. <EOS>

System : Sorry, that is all I have. Would you like to see anything else? <EOS>
System : The white couch chair between the two rugs against the left wall is that brand. <EOS>
System : Sure, I will add those. <EOS>
System : Of course! I have some light colored ones, first to the right just behind the striped rug, then just to the left of that one, and then one in the back on the left side of the second rug. <EOS>
System : Sorry, no, none are cheap. <EOS>
System : Those three that I showed you are the only ones similar to your request, sorry. <EOS>
System : Of course, but unfortunately I can't find anything in leather that matches your search. <EOS>
System : I see you're looking for a leather sofa chair. I can point you towards the white sofa chair in the back, the small white chair in the center and the white chair to your right. <EOS>
System : The chair in the back and the white chair to your right have what you are looking for. <EOS>
System : Which items are you referring to? <EOS>
System : I see that the white chair to your left is by Downtown Consignment and has a customer rating of 4.2, while the white chair to your right is by Modern Arts and is rated 2.9. <EOS>
System : Between the striped rugs, I have the white chair with the tufted detailing on the arms, the other white one to the right of it, and on the striped rug to the back, I have the low backless white chair as well. <EOS>
System : The one with the arms is by Downtown Consignment and costs $349, and the backless one is $449 by Modern Arts. <EOS>
System : For which chair? <EOS>
System : No worries. Both chairs are made of leather. <EOS>

System : This chair is similar. <EOS>
System : Can you be more specific which you mean? <EOS>
System : Both lamps sell for $549 and have the same 4.2 rating. <EOS>
System : I have a white one in the back on the second blue area rug, or I have two more white ones in between the blue rugs. <EOS>
System : Any one of those couch chairs would be a good match. <EOS>
System : Which couch chair are you talking about? <EOS>
System : That couch chair is made of leather and rated 4.2. <EOS>
System : Does the white couch chair atop the blue and white rug interest you? We also have a white couch chair just past the blue chair and another longer chair to the right of that. <EOS>
System : The chair in the back is a Modern Arts leather chair, and the closer chair is a leather Downtown Consignments chair. <EOS>
System : I can suggest the same chairs as before. They all have great ratings. <EOS>
System : Both are from Modern Arts. <EOS>
System : Tell me if you like the white chair located in the back, or these two white sofa chairs in the center of the display. They are all made of leather. <EOS>

System : Okay, wonderful. I've added the chair to your cart. <EOS>
System : I found three that have good ratings. The first is the long white chair on the blue rug towards the middle. The second is the white one between both blue rugs, and the third is the long white chair across from the second option. Thoughts? <EOS>

System : I have two brown coffee tables in the very back of the room. <EOS>
System : Which tables? <EOS>
System : Those tables are identical, both made by Uptown Studio, and cost $399. <EOS>
System : Sorry I don't. Would you like to find something else? <EOS>
System : You may find that the brown table in the back of this room on the right fits your needs. <EOS>
System : I am sorry, this is the only such table today. <EOS>
System : I can offer you the white sofa chair right in front of us and another white sofa chair to the left of it. <EOS>
System : Excellent! You will see it in your cart in a moment. <EOS>
System : The grey sofa in the very back or the small ottoman in the front to the left of the brown sofa might work. <EOS>
System : The grey one? <EOS>
System : It's from 212 Local, and has a 4.7 rating. <EOS>
System : Sorry,  I couldn't find anything like that. <EOS>
System : There are few options: the gray one, the blue one, or the white one. <EOS>
System : The white one is $449, and the blue one is $249. <EOS>
System : I can offer you this other white lamp in the back as well. <EOS>
System : Ok, I will add it. <EOS>
System : Of course! I have the blue one on the left just behind the lamp, the tan one just to its right, and the tan one to the right of the second one, between the two rugs. <EOS>

System : Well for starters, they're both made of leather. <EOS>
System : Sure, there are two in front of that grey couch at the back. <EOS>
System : Perfect, I'm putting that in your cart right now. <EOS>
System : How about the brown one in the back right corner? <EOS>
System : Which one do you mean? <EOS>
System : It is made of metal and has the brand River Chateau. <EOS>
System : Yes, I'll add that to your cart. <EOS>
System : There's a brown chair I found in the back right. <EOS>
System : For which one? <EOS>
System : It's by Modern Arts and costs $299. <EOS>
System : I found nothing matching that criteria. <EOS>
System : What do you think about this grey sofa and this brown sofa? <EOS>
System : Okay, what do you think about the white area rug in the back and the other white area rug in the middle? <EOS>
System : Okay, I will add it to your cart. <EOS>
System : Okay,  I will add it to your cart for you. <EOS>
System : Of course! What do you think of the white one that's the second one back, the blue one behind that, or the white one to the right of those? <EOS>
System : Sorry, I don't have anything like that. <EOS>
System : Both have a 3.6 rating. <EOS>
System : In addition to the one you're talking about, the grey rug in the front and the blue one behind the white one are similar. <EOS>
System : I am sorry but I don't have any affordable tables at the moment. <EOS>
System : Nothing that would match your criteria. <EOS>
System : I am sorry but I do not have anything that would match these criteria. <EOS>
System : The white one has been added to your cart. <EOS>
System : I've found a grey sofa in the very back as well as a brown one in the front here. <EOS>
System : There isn't anything fitting that criteria. <EOS>
System : How about the two brown coffee tables in the middle rug of the room? <EOS>
System : There's no coffee table with a good rating by Modern Arts, unfortunately. <EOS>
System : How about the brown table at the back of the room on the gray rug? <EOS>
System : I don't have an other tables in stock at the moment. <EOS>
System : In brown, we have only that table you just looked at. <EOS>
System : I'm sorry we don't seem to have anything from Uptown Studio with a good rating. <EOS>
System : Sure, straight ahead just beyond the rug is a white ottoman.   At the left on the wall, you can see a blue armchair just at the end of the rug, as well as a white chair just beyond that. <EOS>
System : Sorry, I don't have anything else like that. <EOS>
System : Unfortunately we don't have anything like that at the moment. <EOS>

System : Here is one that meets your criteria. <EOS>
System : Sorry, that's the only option. <EOS>
System : Which one? <EOS>
System : It is $499. <EOS>
System : The grey sofa in the very back, slightly towards the left and the small brown sofa in the very front and to the left of the long, brown sofa could work. What do you think? <EOS>
System : Actually, the only one that matches that criteria is the small brown one. <EOS>
System : Which one? <EOS>
System : Yes, it's made with leather. <EOS>
System : I think those two white rugs in the back could do quite nicely, or you might consider the blue rug in the very back. <EOS>
System : The white rug is rated slightly higher, with an average score of 3.6 as compared to the blue rug's score of 3.4. The blue rug is wool, whereas the white rug is woven from natural fibers. <EOS>
System : Might I suggest you consider the couch chair in blue just past the first rug, the small beige one right behind it, or the long beige ottoman next to that one? <EOS>
System : The small brown couch is made by Downtown Consignment, whereas the brand of that grey sofa is 212 Local. <EOS>
System : An expensive brown chair I have is the brown one in the back right. <EOS>
System : Both are leather couch chairs. <EOS>
System : The blue one to the left is the only similar one. <EOS>
System : Sure, I will go ahead and add the grey sofa from the back to your cart. <EOS>
System : What do you think of the blue chair right up against the left wall at the end of the rug? <EOS>
System : Sorry, nothing in my catalogue matches that description.  What else are you after? <EOS>
System : For sure, I've added two blue chairs to your cart. <EOS>
System : Of course, there are two brown coffee tables way at the back.  What do you think? <EOS>
System : What do you think of that brown one way in the back? <EOS>
System : I'm afraid that's the only one we have. Can I help with something else? <EOS>
System : The white sofa chair is by Downtown Consignment, costs only $349, and comes with a 4.2 overall rating. The blue one is by Downtown Stylists, costs $649, and is rated lower at 3.4. <EOS>
System : Unfortunately, I don't have any other well-rated tables by Modern Arts. <EOS>

System : This sofa we just added to your cart is made from leather. <EOS>
System : I will add two more leather sofas to your cart. <EOS>
System : What do you think of the grey sofa in the back or the smaller brown sofa on the right. <EOS>

System : Which rug do you mean? <EOS>
System : The price for that white rug is $449. <EOS>

System : The red costs $599 and is from River Chateau. The grey is from Modern Arts and is $200 cheaper. <EOS>
System : The white one in the middle and the blue one behind it are both high-end and good quality. <EOS>
System : No. Just those two. Can I find you something else? <EOS>
System : Let's see what rugs we have here for you. How about one of these? <EOS>
System : On what? <EOS>
System : Ah. The blue one is $249 and the white is $449. <EOS>
System : Sure thing. The white rug is $449 from the brand Home Store. It's made of natural fibers and has a solid customer rating of 3.6. The blue one is $249 from River Chateau, is made of wool, and has a slightly lower rating of 3.4. <EOS>
System : Sure, there's a white one in the middle of the room, then a blue one way at the back. <EOS>
System : Of course, I've added one of each rug. <EOS>
System : Sorry, nothing else is too similar.  The blue one is from River Chateau though. <EOS>

System : Okay, I'll go ahead and update your cart with one grey sofa and one red sofa. <EOS>

System : You would be wise to give that grey sofa in the back left and the long red one on the white zig-zag rug some thought. <EOS>
System : Certainly! Home Store makes the white rug, while River Chateau is the brand that makes the bluish rug. The white rug is woven from natural fibers, whereas the bluish rug is made of wool.

System : Sure, which table would you like the materials for? <EOS>
System : I don't mind at all!  And they're actually both made from the same material, which is metal. <EOS>
System : Nothing else right now, unfortunately. <EOS>
System : Sure, I have a grey area rug in the foreground and another grey one further back. What do you think of those? <EOS>
System : Could you clarify which you're referring to? <EOS>
System : That rug is wool and costs $499. <EOS>
System : I'm sorry, I can't find anything with those criteria. Can I help with something else? <EOS>
System : I can definitely help. What do you think about the grey one in the back or the grey one closer here in the front? <EOS>
System : Sure, we have the brown one in front of the red sofa there and the brown one in front of that. What do you think? <EOS>
System : Yes, the closest one is by Uptown Studio and has a 3.5 customer rating, while the one behind it is by Uptown Studio and has a 3.5 rating. <EOS>

System : Both of those coffee tables are made of metal. <EOS>
System : Both of those coffee tables also have a good rating. <EOS>
System : For which items? <EOS>
System : How do you like the white one? <EOS>
System : Just that one. <EOS>
System : I don't have anything fitting that description. <EOS>
System : Sure. It's in your cart. <EOS>
System : Do you like these two gray ones? <EOS>
System : I only have those two options. <EOS>

System : I'll add those to your cart as well. <EOS>
System : What do you think of the white one in the middle of the room? <EOS>
System : That's the only sofa available. <EOS>
System : Can you be more specific? <EOS>
System : Both are from North Lodge and retail for $499. <EOS>
System : That white option over there on the white rug is quite luxurious, with a hefty price tag to match! <EOS>

System : With pleasure! Hang tight and I will take care of that for you. <EOS>
System : What do you think of the white sofa on the grey rug over there? <EOS>
System : I didn't find anything matching those specifics, sorry. <EOS>
System : Not based on what you said, sorry. <EOS>
System : The two grey rugs might work for you? <EOS>
System : There's a white sofa facing away from us in the corner set. <EOS>

System : Okay, I'll add those now. <EOS>
System : What do you think of this white sofa in the center? <EOS>
System : This white sofa is the only thing that matches that description. <EOS>
System : Of course, I'll add those for you now. <EOS>
System : I'm afraid that's the only option available. Can I help with something else? <EOS>
System : I have the white sofa in the display in front and away from us, by the room divider. That sofa is facing away from us. Does it look like what you are searching for? <EOS>
System : Which sofa are you looking at? <EOS>
System : Thank you! That sofa is upholstered in leather. <EOS>
System : That sofa is made by Global Voyager. <EOS>
System : How is this white one on the grey rug? <EOS>

System : Sorry, which item are you referring to? <EOS>
System : Ok, that leather couch has a 4.3 rating. <EOS>
System : The grey rug that sofa is on is one option. The other option is the grey rug closer to the front of the shop. <EOS>

System : Adding it now. <EOS>
System : I didn't find any jackets in that color scheme. <EOS>
System : Perhaps you would like the grey coat or the black coat to the left of the blue jacket from earlier, or the brown coat in front. <EOS>
System : Got it, adding those now. <EOS>
System : Do you like the brown one close to you, the grey one on the top shelf or the black one behind it? <EOS>
System : In addition to that item, we also have the black one behind it and the blue one above it. <EOS>
System : The only others appear to the be grey one and black one on the top row and the brown one closest to you. <EOS>
System : Would you mind specifying which one you mean? <EOS>
System : That's shown in size XXL. <EOS>
System : Sure can! Take a look at that brown hoodie at the back of that wooden rack in the middle of the floor. <EOS>
System : See if you like that black one hanging up front to the left or the red and white one in the very back. <EOS>
System : The black dress is a medium, while the olive one is a large. <EOS>
System : I will see to that right away! <EOS>
System : I will happily add those pieces to your cart. <EOS>
System : There is the pink shirt along the wall. <EOS>
System : They both have full length sleeves. <EOS>
System : There are several, including a brown dress, an olive dress, and a black dress. <EOS>

System : The one on the right is a gray memory foam bed from Home Store.  It has a 3.1 rating and costs $349.  The one on the left is also a gray memory foam bed, but it is from StyleNow Feed with a 3.9 rating and costs $599. <EOS>
System : Do you like the white chair next the table? <EOS>
System : We don't currently have any other options of low-cost white chairs. Is there something else you'd like to shop for? <EOS>
System : Sorry, this white chair is our only option. <EOS>
System : Sorry, can you specify the items you'd like me to compare ratings on? <EOS>
System : For that, I'd suggest the bed with the high headboard, or the one in the right corner of the shoew room. <EOS>
System : I can tell you that both rugs are white. <EOS>
System : Certainly.  Adding the rugs now. <EOS>
System : Great, adding a second white rug, and the gray bed to your cart as well. <EOS>

System : I'll add them both. <EOS>
System : I have the white rug at the back under the beds, and the white rug in the front of the room under the table and chair. <EOS>
System : Unfortunately, I don't happen to have any cheap area rugs at the moment. <EOS>
System : Sure thing, I'll add the bed and those shelves to your cart now. <EOS>
System : Sure thing.  I'll update your cart for you. <EOS>

System : Okay. Your cart has been updated. <EOS>
System : Here is a set of shelves by Modern Arts. <EOS>
System : Here are wooden shelves. <EOS>
System : Which one? <EOS>
System : It is made of wood. <EOS>
System : Are the two plain white rugs to your liking? <EOS>
System : No problem! <EOS>
System : These rugs actually go for the same price of $249. <EOS>
System : I'm sorry the prices are unsatisfactory to you, but I am unable to come up with any cheaper rugs that fit your preferences. Is there any other way I might be of assistance? <EOS>
System : How is this white rug to your left? I also have another white rug in the back. <EOS>
System : Which rugs, exactly? <EOS>
System : Both of those rugs are made with natural fibers. <EOS>
System : Those are the only shelves like that. <EOS>
System : Sorry, I don't have any of those. <EOS>

System : I am sorry but I couldn't find anything that would match your criteria. <EOS>
System : I will add them! <EOS>
System : You're in luck as I've found two grey beds against the back wall that you might fancy. <EOS>
System : No, nothing with wood. Anything else you wanna look for? <EOS>
System : We have a white chair in the front left furniture set. <EOS>
System : No chair I found is by that brand and white, sorry. <EOS>
System : Take a look at the bed in the back right. <EOS>
System : I'm sorry there isn't another bed which fits your request. How else may I be of assistance to you today? <EOS>

System : Unfortunately no, is there anything else you happen to be after? <EOS>
System : For sure!  It's in your cart. <EOS>
System : Unfortunately not. <EOS>
System : Sure thing.  For expensive beds with good customer ratings, we have the gray one with the headboard against the far wall, and the one sitting perpendicular to that one, with the gray comforter over it. <EOS>
System : I'm sorry, we don't have any beds in leather. <EOS>
System : The two you already saw are both gray. <EOS>
System : Sure thing.  Adding that bed to your cart now. <EOS>

System : How about the rug in front of the close wall, or maybe the one in the back under the bed? <EOS>
System : How about the bed in the back middle, or the one to the right of that? <EOS>
System : I can't find anything similar with those criteria. <EOS>
System : Okay, I'll add those to your cart. <EOS>
System : I have these two on the right. Do you find either one interesting? <EOS>
System : Here's one on front of the table. Your thoughts? <EOS>
System : That's all we currently have in stock, I'm sorry. <EOS>
System : OK, I'll place it in your cart. <EOS>
System : How about the bed on the back right? It's from Home Store. <EOS>

System : Glad you like it! I'll put that in your cart straight away. <EOS>
System : Regrettably, I cannot find anything of that nature. What else can I do for you today? <EOS>
System : Sorry, which items do you wish to know more about? <EOS>
System : What do you think of the white rug in the back under the bed, or maybe the white one in the front? Both are highly rated. <EOS>
